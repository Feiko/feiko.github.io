			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Blog like Scott Hanselman. What self-respecting .net developer has not thought about writing their own blogs? I certainly have. As a Internet of Things Specialist and .net developer I have embarked on many IT adventures over the years. Adventures of lessons learned, amusement, frustrations and wins that I’d love to share with the world. Being a none native English speaking dyslexic has held me from doing this, but no longer! With this blog about creating a 100% .NET powered static website for free, I’m officially launching my own blog and video website. Feiko.IO says: “HELLO WORLD!!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I decided to start a blog website I soon found out that hosting a cool Umbraco powered WEB app on Azure is quite expensive for a small site. The cheapest usable Web App tier would set me back 46 euro a month. This is way too much for this stubborn, lazy cheap ass developer. So I decided that ASP.NET is a no go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the website world has radically changed since I build my last website in 2014. It’s a brave new world out there. Finally I found a solution to my website problem: Static Websites! Static websites are fast and cheap. But being a stubborn developer I want to build this website using .net technology, using ASP.NET goodies like Visual Studio tooling, Razor script and CSHTML. And atop on everything I want a dynamic Content Management System. Follow me on my adventure in creating the ideal .net static Website, like the one you are on right now! Because: Yes, you can have it all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog I’ll show you how to quickly create your own simple .net powered static blog website using the CleanBlog theme. Next week, in part II, we’ll talk about adding a headless flat-file Content Management System and hosting your site for free on GitHub Pages. It’s all about making blogging fun and easy!&lt;/p&gt;
